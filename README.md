# Migration Data Analysis

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of internal migration statistics for the years between 2016 and 2022 provided by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK). The data was downloaded from the official TÜİK website.

## Data Preparation

The data was prepared for analysis using Python. This process involved changing the data type of the date column to 'date' and filling in missing values. These steps ensured the data was consistent and suitable for analysis.

## Dashboard

The report analyzes various aspects of the migration data through visualizations:

- The first page examines the trend of population migration into and out of Turkey over the years, as well as the age range of migrants.
- The second page shows the distribution of incoming migration by province and nationality, as well as the gender distribution of migrants.
- The final page presents a heat map of the nationalities of incoming migrants on a world map. This visualization helps to identify regions with higher migration rates.

This project aims to help us better understand migration trends.
